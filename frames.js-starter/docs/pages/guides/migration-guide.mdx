# Migration Guides

## 0.9.x Breaking changes

### Version 0.9 changes many APIs and decouples frames.js to no longer require next.js

- Removes `useReducer` and state handling from computing from previous state to buttons defining the next state directly
- Removes the need for `useReducer`, instead providing context via the `frames` function and middleware
- Internal URL query parameters have changed
- Imports have changed slightly
- Routes now use JSX, so you may need to rename `route.ts` to `route.tsx`
- For next.js app router, metadata is done via the `generateMetadata` function instead of rendering meta tags in the body
- Replacing `<FrameContainer>`, JSX is now done within a `JSON` object return
