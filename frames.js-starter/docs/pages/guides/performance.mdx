# Performance best practices

For the best UX, frames should be fast and snappy. Frame responses also have a 5 second timeout time to be aware of. 
We recommend the following best practices:

1. Avoid using dynamic images when possible, opting for static ones instead
2. For slow APIs like LLMs, we recommend responding with a "loading frame" that has a refresh button rather than waiting for the response.
3. Consider the physical location of the servers you're deploying to - we recommend these be in north america for the time being.
