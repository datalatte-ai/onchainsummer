# POST

Proxies a POST request to the specified `postUrl` with the payload provided in the request body.

## Usage

```tsx [./frames/route.tsx]
export { GET, POST } from "@frames.js/render/next';
```

### Request

- **URL Query Parameters:**

  - `postType` (optional): A string indicating the type of the POST request. It can be either `post_redirect` to handle redirects manually or `tx` for transaction requests.
  - `postUrl` (required): The URL to which the POST request should be proxied.

- **Body:** JSON payload conforming to the `FrameActionPayload` structure imported from `frames.js`.

### Response

The response varies depending on the `postType` and the status of the request to the `postUrl`.

- **For a 302 status code from `postUrl`:**

  - Returns a JSON object containing the `location` header value from the response, with a status code of 302.

- **For `postType` of `tx`:**

  - Returns the JSON response received from the `postUrl`.

- **For other responses:**
  - Attempts to extract a frame from the HTML content returned by the `postUrl`, using the `getFrame` function from `frames.js`. Returns a JSON object containing the frame data and any errors encountered during the frame extraction process.

### Errors

- Returns a response generated by `Response.error()` in case of:
  - Absence of the `postUrl` parameter in the request.
  - Any fetch operation or processing errors.
